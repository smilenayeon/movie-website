Project Overview:
Developed a responsive and user-friendly movie search application that allows users to search for movies and view detailed information. The application is hosted on Netlify and interfaces with The Movie Database (TMDb) API to fetch real-time movie data.

Key Features:

Dynamic Search Functionality: Implemented an intuitive search feature that enables users to find movies by title. The search results update dynamically based on user input.

Movie Details View: Designed a detailed view for each movie, which opens in a new tab and provides comprehensive information, including title, release date, synopsis, ratings, and more.

Responsive Design: Crafted a mobile-responsive layout ensuring a seamless user experience across various devices and screen sizes.

Efficient State Management: Utilized React Hooks for effective state management, enhancing the application's performance and user experience.

Technical Highlights:

API Integration: Successfully integrated and managed external API requests to TMDb for fetching and displaying movie data.

Error Handling: Implemented robust error handling to manage API request failures and improve the application's reliability.

Performance Optimization: Employed optimization techniques such as efficient state updates and conditional rendering to ensure a smooth and fast user experience.

Challenges Overcome:

Handling Asynchronous Data: Developed a mechanism to handle asynchronous API calls and state updates, ensuring data consistency and preventing issues like memory leaks or unnecessary re-renders.

Cross-Browser Compatibility: Addressed various cross-browser compatibility issues to ensure consistent functionality and appearance across different web browsers.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
